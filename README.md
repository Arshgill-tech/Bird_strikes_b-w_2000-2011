BIRD STRIKE DATA ANALYSIS REPORT: 
Exploratory Data Analysis Project with POWER BI, SQL, EXCEL
INTERNSHIP PERIOD: 15 JULY – 15 AUGUST 2024 

OBJECTIVE:
This project explores Bird strike data of the US between 2000-2011, to understand top-performing branches and products, sales trends of different products & customer behavior. The aim is to study how sales strategies can be improved and optimized. Ververidge provided the data set to complete the project and extract various information. Here in this project, I developed a power BI dashboard to present insights into Bird strike data, highlighting region-specific and item-specific strikes analyses across different years, quarters, months, and days. This comprehensive dashboard offers detailed insights into various strikes. 

Problem Statement:

Transport and communication is one of the crucial domain in the field of analytics.
Environmental impacts and safety are, nowadays, two major concerns of the
scientific community with respect to transport scenarios and to the ever-growing
urban areas. These issues gain more importance due to the increasing amount of
vehicles and people.
Seeking for new solutions is reaching a point where available technologies and
artificial intelligence, especially MAS, are being recognized as ways to cope and
tackle these these kinds of problems in a distributed and more appropriate way.
